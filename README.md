# U N R A Y

*A game developed by Hunter K*

## How to run

Install [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/), clone this repo, then run `go build`

### Why is this game open source now?

I had originally planned on finishing this game, but the artist stopped making art for the game and I just don't have the time or skills to get good at art, nor the money to hire a new artist.

My hope is that someone will revive the game (and fix the pathfinding, ha) or use parts from this game to better their own.
